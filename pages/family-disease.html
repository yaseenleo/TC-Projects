                    <p>Drug abuse can transform a son or daughter into an untrustworthy stranger, and it can turn a
                        parent into an unpredictable tyrant. Addiction is referred to as a ‘family disease’ because it
                        only takes one member of this unit to become addicted for the whole family to become
                        dysfunctional.

                        It is common for the rest of the family to feel somehow responsible for the addictive behaviour
                        – “maybe if we had tried harder” or “if only we had seen the signs sooner’. Those who fall into
                        substance abuse can become highly skilled at manipulating the rest of the family by taking
                        advantage of these feelings of guilt – e.g. kids can made to feel incredibly guilty when a
                        parent tells them, “if only you behaved better, I wouldn’t need to drink so much”.</p>

                    <p>Addiction tends to isolate families due to shame about what is going on. The family is pushed
                        tighter together due to the need to hide the problem, and there can be a real sense of ‘us and
                        them’. Parents may become willing to lie in order to protect their addicted child, and kids may
                        be afraid to invite friends home in case mum or dad is drunk.

                        Living with an addict means life can become like an emotional rollercoaster, and the mood of
                        this one person can decide the type of day everyone else is going to have. The scary thing is
                        how fast and unpredictable these mood changes occur – it can be all jokes and laughter one
                        minute, but like a click of a switch the person is shouting and throwing things around. Living
                        in this type of situation can be incredibly stressful, and there can often be physical abuse as
                        well.</p>

                    <p>Addiction is not the same as doing something all the time because you like it although the word
                        is
                        often misused in this way – you will hear people say things like “I’m addicted to this new
                        flavour
                        of yogurt’. The addiction we are talking about here is where changes have occurred in a person’s
                        brain that leads to an inability to stop a behaviour even when the person decides to quit.

                        Addiction involves both physical and psychological dependence. To say people are psychologically
                        addicted means they experience cravings, and they find it hard to imagine how they could cope
                        without the drug. Physical addiction occurs because the body needs to adapt to the substance
                        abuse –
                        it does this by developing tolerance. Once people become physically addicted, it means they are
                        going to experience withdrawal substances when they stop using the substance.</p>

                    <p>It is not necessary for people to become physically addicted before a mind-altering substance
                        starts to cause serious problems in their life. Problem drinkers can behave in much the same way
                        as alcoholics, and a first-time drug user could become psychotic or overdose.</p>

                    <p>Mothers and fathers can miss the sighs of alcohol or drug abuse for a long time, and it doesn’t
                        mean they are bad parents. Teenagers can quickly become skilled at hiding the effects of
                        substance use, and it is easy to blame changes in their behaviour on the normal ups and downs of
                        adolescence. This is why it is so important for parents to be looking for out for signs of drug
                        abuse, and to act on any intuition they might have that something is wrong with their child.

                        It is vital to deal with any suspicion of substance abuse quickly because the longer a child is
                        allowed to use alcohol or drugs, the more likelihood of them becoming addicted. Drugs like
                        methamphetamine and heroin can lead to addiction rapidly because the effects of these chemicals
                        are so pleasurable. Common signs of alcohol or drug abuse would include:</p>

                    <h2>Why Do Kids Become Addicted?</h2>
                    <p>The one question most parents are desperate to know is – why? Did they do something wrong? How
                        could
                        they have prevented it from happening? Nobody ever really sets out with the intention of
                        becoming
                        addicted to alcohol or drugs, and it is scary how easy a trap this is for kids to fall into.

                        Adults can forget just how powerful peer pressure can be during those teenage years, but saying
                        ‘no’
                        to something that the ‘cool’ kids are doing isn’t easy. Adolescents can feel desperate to fit in
                        with their friends, and refusing to join in can mean being ostracised by the group. Sometimes it
                        is
                        just easier to go along with everyone else, and this means even a sensible teenager can end up
                        in
                        the clutches of addiction.</p>
                    <p>In some cases, teenagers can be experiencing the early mild symptoms of a mental health problem
                        like
                        bipolar disorder or anxiety disorder. They use alcohol or drugs, and it makes them feel better.
                        The
                        young person ends up addicted because they are self-medicating this condition – even though this
                        person may not be consciously aware that this is what is happening. There can be lots of other
                        reasons for why young people feel unable to cope in life and substance abuse can seem to offer
                        an
                        easy solution.

                        It is also believed that some teenagers are particularly prone to falling into addiction due to
                        their genes or personality. Those young people who grow up in a home where the people around
                        them
                        engage in substance abuse can just assume this behaviour is normal.</p>

                    <h2>What to do if You Suspect Your Child is Abusing Drugs</h2>

                    <p>If your child is abusing alcohol or drugs, it means they are in serious danger. Young people
                        can suffer more serious consequences due to addiction than adults because their brain is
                        still developing – their bodies are also less well able to handle these chemicals than
                        adults. If you suspect your child of engaging in substance abuse you need to take action
                        fast.</p>
                    <p>The first thing to do is to confront your child with your suspicions. Don’t lose your
                        temper, or become hysteria, as this will just put this young person on the defensive. You
                        need to calmly explain why you suspect drug abuse, and the action you are going to take if
                        the behaviour continues. Listen to any explanation your child offers, but don’t accept these
                        answers too readily and expect some denial – those who are caught up in addiction soon learn
                        to be deceitful and manipulative. Try to find out why they are abusing alcohol or drugs
                        without looking for someone to blame – let the child explain using his or her own words.

                        In some cases, the ‘softly-softly’ approach will be enough to get your child to admit to the
                        problem and agree to get help. If this doesn’t work, you are going to need to give an
                        ultimatum. This means outlining the penalties for continuance with the behaviour. You should
                        only give an ultimatum if you are prepared to follow it through. Your family can also stage
                        an intervention in order to pressurise your child into entering rehab. Don’t believe the
                        myth that a person has to willing to enter rehab in order for it to be effective – there are
                        plenty of stories of young people who went to rehab reluctantly but had a change of heart
                        while they were there.</p>

                    <p>It is vital you understand what you are dealing with if your child had become addicted to
                        alcohol or drugs. It is no good expecting this young person to just use willpower to end the
                        behaviour. They are likely to need professional help, and in a lot of cases, the best option
                        is going to be an inpatient rehab programme. If your child is dealing with a dual diagnosis
                        (a mental health problem like depression alongside the addiction), you will need specialised
                        help for this.</p>

            <h2>Things to Avoid When Dealing with Teenage Substance Abuse</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>trying to minimise the behaviour – e.g. saying it is just part of growing up</li>
                <li>covering up for or enabling the substance abuse – e.g. telling lies to keep your loved one out of
                    trouble</li>
                <li>losing your temper</li>
                <li>making it all about you – “you have hurt me so much”</li>
                <li>getting physically aggressive</li>
                <li>refusing to consider treatment for teenagers because you believe they are ‘too young’ to be addicted
                </li>
                <li>giving ultimatums that you are not prepared to follow-up on – this just reduces your credibility
                </li>
                <li>arguing with your child when he/she is high</li>
                <li>allow your child to use your love as tool of manipulation</li>

                    <p>If one or both of your parents is addicted to alcohol or drugs, it can mean your home life is
                        incredibly challenging. These people should be taken care of you, but the substance abuse may
                        mean you have needed to take on the caring role. Worst of all, you may feel responsible for your
                        parent’s behaviour – if only you were a better son or daughter, maybe they wouldn’t need to get
                        high? This type of thinking is common, and a parent may have even told you this is the case, but
                        it is vital you understand that none of this is your fault.</p>

                    <h5 class="text-left mt-2">In the recovery community we talk about the 3 C’s, and this refers to three
                        things you need to
                        understand about your parent’s behaviour:</h5>

                    <div>
                        <ol>
                            <li>you did not cause the addictive behaviour</li>
                            <li>you cannot control the addictive behaviour</li>
                            <li>it is not your job to cure the addiction</li>
                        </ol>
                    </div>

                    <p>One of the key things you need to be doing if you are dealing with an addicted parent is getting
                        plenty of support. There are 12-step fellowships like Al-Anon and Alateen – there is also Adult
                        Children of Alcoholics if you are a bit older. You will also find help online, but it is better
                        to get at least some face-to- face support. If your parent becomes ready for addiction
                        treatment, you will want to be supportive of the idea, but it shouldn’t be your job to sort
                        everything out – especially if you are still a teenager.</p>

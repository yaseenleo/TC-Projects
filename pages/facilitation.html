                    <p>Twelve-Step Facilitation (TSF) consists of a brief, structured, and manual-driven approach to
                        facilitating early recovery from alcohol abuse/alcoholism and other drug abuse/addiction.

                        It is based in behavioral, spiritual, and cognitive principles that form the core of 12-step
                        fellowships such as Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and Narcotics Anonymous (NA). It is suitable for
                        problem drinkers and other drug users and for those who are alcohol or other drug dependent.

                        TSF seeks to facilitate two general goals in individuals with alcohol or other drug problems:
                        acceptance (of the need for abstinence from alcohol or other drug use) and surrender, or the
                        willingness to participate actively in 12-step fellowships as a means of sustaining sobriety.

                        These goals are in turn broken down into a series of cognitive, emotional, relationship,
                        behavioral, social, and spiritual objectives.</p>

                                        with their inner selves through the inspiration of images and their physical
                                        manifestation in artistic expression. Art therapy helps restore physical, mental
                                        and

                                        identifying and managing feelings and behaviors, and improving awareness and

                                    <p>After a person who has been struggling with an addiction overcomes the initial

                                        of becoming sober, a new set of challenges emerge. At this point, staying sober
                                        is
                                        the goal, and doing so requires goal setting, plenty of focus and a healthy dose
                                        of
                                        optimism.

                                    <p> This is where hypnosis as a treatment for addiction really becomes effective. It
                                        allows the patient to get involved in the treatment process, letting them
                                        explore
                                        their own triggers for relapse and giving them tools to deconstruct a craving

                                    <p>Family therapy is a type of psychotherapy that is designed to help family members
                                        improve communication and resolve their conflicts. Typically this therapy is
                                        performed by a licensed therapist, clinical social worker or a psychologist.

                                        Since addiction is a family disease, it is important for other members of the
                                        family
                                        to receive treatment so that they can deal with specific issues relating to the
                                        family member’s substance abuse, mental illness or other problems. At Promises,
                                        we
                                        have found that about 90 percent of family members want to be involved in the
                                        treatment of their loved one.</p>
                                    <p>
                                        Our family therapy program is designed to help family members gain awareness and
                                        understanding, so that they can learn how to best support their loved one and
                                        themselves. Family therapy may include all or only some family members. The
                                        specific
                                        treatment plan depends on family needs. We employ two full-time family
                                        therapists
                                        who meet individually with their client to work on individual family issues and

                                    <p>Treatment is the beginning of a lifelong journey of discovery and recovery, but
                                        what
                                        happens after treatment is equally as important as the treatment itself.

                                        Recovery begins in treatment and continues with comprehensive continuing care as
                                        the
                                        patient transition from the confines of a supportive, safe environment into the
                                        world.</p>
                                    <p>Upon completion of an addiction treatment program, transitioning to the day to
                                        day
                                        of a “normal” life may be difficult, thus requiring additional support,
                                        encouragement, and a sense of solidarity. Without the availability of such an
                                        option, addicts may find themselves prone to temptation and relapse,
                                        particularly
                                        when considering the severity of the addiction and the substance abused.

                                        They will be able to encounter challenges that previously would have sent them
                                        searching for substances and use the new behaviors developed in treatment,
                                        resist
                                        triggers, prevent relapse and improve their ability to pursue long-term
                                        recovery.

                    <p>The goal of this program is daily ongoing care and support of the patient’s efforts to
                        incorporate the skills and strategies learned in primary treatment into daily life.
                        Participation in this program strengthens new patterns of sobriety as individuals reintegrate
                        into community activities.

                        The Early Recovery Program is a continuing care program that involves meeting five times a week
                        for twelve weeks. It includes group therapy, Psycho education and individual counseling, as well
                        as follow-up assessments and urine testing.</p>

                        recovery, and it includes the opportunity to process challenges to sobriety.

                        This program provides the opportunity for weekly meetings up to six to nine months, as
                        determined by their individualized treatment plan. In this program, patients continue with group
                        sessions and one-to-one counseling, as well as follow-up assessments and drug testing</p>

                    <p>Alcoholics Anonymous/Narcotics Anonymous (commonly referred to as AA/NA) is perhaps the most
                        widely known program related to overcoming an addiction or chemical dependency. For decades,
                        AA/NA meetings have helped countless addicts overcome their dependence upon alcohol/drugs and
                        begin (or continue) their pursuit of lifelong recovery.

                        Though any form of addiction recovery can be a complex and challenging process, the central
                        tenet of AA meetings is fairly simple and straightforward. This is how AA describes itself (from
                        the AA website):</p>
                    <p>Alcoholics Anonymous® is a fellowship of men and women who share their experience, strength and
                        hope with each other that they may solve their common problem and help others to recover from
                        alcoholism. The only requirement for membership is a desire to stop drinking.</p>
                    <p>AA meetings are designed as supportive environments for individuals who are in all stages of
                        recovery. The foundation of AA meetings – indeed, the foundation of the entire AA program – is
                        expressed in the 12 Steps, a process that was developed in the early days of AA meetings, and
                        which is now embraced by addiction treatment programs throughout the world.</p>

                    <h3 class="offer-heading">Family Therapy</h3>
                    <p>Healing the family doesn’t end when the addict graduates from rehab. Ongoing therapy for spouses,
                        parents and children is a key component of a successful continuing care program. Addiction
                        research shows that keeping the family involved in recovery process can make all the difference
                        in the world in the chances of long-term success.

                        Families are encouraged to attend their weekly sessions/programs to get ongoing support,
                        education and professional advice.</p>
